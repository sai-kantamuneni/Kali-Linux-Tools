# Kali-Linux-Tools

Kali Linux is an open-source, Debian-based Linux distribution specifically designed for advanced penetration testing and security auditing. It comes pre-installed with over 600 penetration testing and security related tools.

In this series, I will be sharing the labs I practice using the tools that are available in Kali Linux. I will also be sharing my analysis of the different tools.

Before we begin honing our skills, we first need to install Kali Linux on a Virtual Machine because it isolates it from your host system preventing potential security risks.

## Individual Labs

These labs are a part of a series called CompTIA Security+ Labs under 101Labs. You can access them here - https://www.101labs.net/comptia-security/

## Analysis of Tools (Coming Soon)

In this section, I will be attempting to provide an in-depth analysis of my research into the different tools available in Kali Linux.
