## Nmap
**Nmap (Network Mapper)** is one of the most common tools used among hackers and system administrators. It is used to scan a host, which can be a server, computer or a network.

When running an Nmap scan, the goal is discover various types of information such as:
* Devices that are connected to a network
* Ports that are open on a device
* Services that are running on these ports

In today's lab we will be scanning the following site: <a href="http://scanme.nmap.org/">Nmap.org</a>

This website has been developed by Nmap for the purpose of scanning.

**NOTE: Never scan any site, system, or network without prior permission from the owner.**
